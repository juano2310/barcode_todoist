# Barcode Scanner, Semantics3 and Todoist
Using a USB barcode scanner you can scan an item, get the product name from Semantics3 and add it to a list on Todoist.

Every time I run out of something I just scan it and it adds it to my "Shopping" list that I also share with my wife. 

For this project I used a Raspberry Pi and Adafruit Barcode Reader/Scanner Module - CCD Camera - USB Interface (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1203)
